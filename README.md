`functions.spec.js` is an array of passing unit tests which demonstrate the opposite of best practice
Understanding what is wrong with them, and how they can be fixed, can help develop better unit test writing habits.

The `feature.md` and associated src & test files are intended as a springboard for demonstrating TDD in practice.

There is no 'final' version of these since the whole point is the practice.
